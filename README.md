## 🚀 Running the Website

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

---

### 📦 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lanceferr/studdit.git
```

---

### 📥 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### ▶️ 3. Run the Server

To start the backend server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Or, for development mode with live reloading (requires `nodemon`):

```bash
npm run dev
```

> By default, the server runs from `src/server.js`. Make sure this file exists and is correctly configured.

---

### 🌐 4. View in Browser

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

> Port may vary depending on your configuration. Check your terminal output.

---

### 🛠 Optional: Install nodemon Globally

If you're using `npm run dev` and haven't installed `nodemon` globally yet:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```
